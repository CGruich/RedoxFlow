# RedoxFlow

RedoxFlow is an agentic proof-of-concept that prepares redox potential simulations en-masse for electrochemical discovery.

Redox potential quantifies how willing an organic chemical is to being reduced or oxidized and thus is useful in many electrochemical applications, such as:
* Batteries & Flow Batteries (e.g., anode/cathode couple selection, screening redox-active electrolytes/mediators)
* Photosensors & Bioelectrochemistry (e.g., select an organic via redox potential that avoids oxygen/hydrogen interference)
* Environmental Electrochemistry (e.g., quantify the redox potential of contaminants to predict likelihood of harmful byproducts)
* Redox-swing Separations & CO2 Capture (e.g., select redox potential to quantify the binding/unbinding window for chemical separations)

A common method for computing redox potentials is the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) method. Using this method often amounts to calculating a thermocycle. The RedoxFlow premise is that an agentic AI can automate simulation preparation for this thermocycle calculation.

Such a calculation is arduous and not conducive to high-throughput chemistry workflows. 
For a model reduction reaction `A + xH^+ + ye^- → B`, a researcher typically must: 
(1) Prepare a simulation script for `A`
(2) Prepare a simulation script for `B`
(3) Prepare a simulation script for `H~2` as a proxy substitution for `H^+` and `e^-`
(4) Provide some flavor of solvation correction
(5) Run the simulations
(6) Extract the relevant variables from simulations
(7) Calculate the redox potential `E = -ΔG/zF`, where `E` is redox potential, `ΔG` is solvated free energy of reaction, `z` is the number of participating electrons, and `F` is Faraday's constant.

 RedoxFlow is a proof-of-concept that automates simulation preparation (i.e., steps (1)-(4)). After running the prepared simulations, the agent is wrapped in an interface that automates calculation steps (6), (7).

RedoxFlow auto-prepares simulation scripts by:
*(1) Generating reactants via a foundational model (ibm-research/GP-MoLFormer-Uniq) designed for _de novo_ generation of molecules
*(2) Predicting an array of reduced products (in our proof-of-concept, using transparent reaction rules)
*(3) Conformer searching the reactants/products
*(4) Writing the finalized molecules and associated simulation scripts for lowest-energy conformers 

Through a function-based interface, the researcher has access to several knobs that control the chemical diversity of generated reactant:
*Number of generated reactant candidates (`num_generated_candidates`)
*Maximum non-H atoms per generated reactant (`max_heavy_atoms_per_reactant`)
*Minimum number of non-carbon elements per generated reactant (`min_uniq_elements`)
*Electronegative presence/token volatility in generated reactants (`temperature`)

Upon first-use, the agent creates persistent memory to remember generated reactants (`RedoxFlow/memory/reactants_memory.csv`) and products (`RedoxFlow/memory/product_memory.csv`) to filter redundantly generated chemicals. Reaction rules (`RedoxFlow/scripts/reactions.json`) can be transparently adjusted to tailor predicted products. The agent is loaded directly from `redoxflow.json` and thus can be deployed locally or on HPC filesystems to prepare simulations.

Importance of Redox Potentials

Redox potentials are quantities that represent how easily oxidizable or reducible an organic chemical is.
