# RedoxFlow

RedoxFlow is an agentic proof-of-concept that prepares redox potential simulations of solvated chemicals en-masse for electrochemical discovery.

**Background**
Redox potential quantifies how willing an organic chemical is to being reduced or oxidized. It is useful in many electrochemical applications, such as:

* Batteries & Flow Batteries (e.g., anode/cathode couple selection, screening redox-active electrolytes/mediators)
* Photosensors & Bioelectrochemistry (e.g., select an organic via redox potential that avoids oxygen/hydrogen interference)
* Environmental Electrochemistry (e.g., quantify the redox potential of contaminants to predict likelihood of harmful byproducts)
* Redox-swing Separations & CO2 Capture (e.g., select redox potential to quantify the binding/unbinding window for chemical separations)

A common method for computing redox potentials is the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) method. Using this method often amounts to calculating a thermocycle. The project premise is that an agentic AI can prepare the simulation scripts for this method en-masse for large-scale chemical search and discovery.

Such a thermocycle is arduous by-hand and not conducive to high-throughput chemistry workflows. 
For a model reduction reaction `A + xH^+ + ye^- → B`, a researcher typically must: 

* (1) Prepare a simulation script for `A`
* (2) Prepare a simulation script for `B`
* (3) Conformer search `A` and `B` to determine reasonable initial geometries for the molecules
* (4) Prepare a simulation script for `H~2` as a proxy for `H^+` and `e^-` as allowed by the CHE method
* (5) Prepare some flavor of solvation correction
* (6) Run the simulations
* (7) Extract the relevant variables from simulations
* (8) Calculate the redox potential `E = -ΔG/zF`, where `E` is redox potential, `ΔG` is solvated free energy of reaction derived from simulations, `z` is the number of participating electrons, and `F` is Faraday's constant.

 RedoxFlow automates simulation preparation (i.e., steps (1)-(5)) and redox potential calculation (i.e., steps (7), (8)). 

Simulation scripts are auto-generated by:
* (1) Generating reactants via a foundational model (ibm-research/GP-MoLFormer-Uniq) designed for _de novo_ generation of molecules
* (2) Predicting an array of reduced products (in our proof-of-concept, using transparent reaction rules)
* (3) Conformer searching the reactants/products
* (4) Writing the lowest energy conformers and associated simulation scripts to disk

The researcher has access to several knobs that control the chemical diversity of generated reactants (see demonstration). The agent is loaded directly from `redoxflow.json` and thus can be deployed locally or on HPC filesystems to prepare simulations. The foundational model used by the agent to generate reactants is ~46.8 million parameters, lightweight and adaptable to local machine or cluster for CPU or GPU usage.

**Memory**
Upon first-use, the agent creates persistent memory to remember generated reactants (`RedoxFlow/memory/reactants_memory.csv`) and products (`RedoxFlow/memory/product_memory.csv`). Reaction rules (`RedoxFlow/scripts/reactions.json`) can be transparently adjusted to tailor predicted products. 

**Proof-of-Concept Restrictions:**
To show that the agentic workflow works start-to-finish, we restrict our agent to only prepare simulation scripts for:
* CNOF-containing molecules
* A model reduction reaction `A + xH^+ + ye^- → B`
    * No degradation products considered
    * By nature of the model reaction, we only consider PCET-reactions.

For a round-trip demonstration of redox potential calculation with the agent/embedded class interface, we:
* Generate 10 simulations (5 reactants/5 products) and thus 5 redox potentials
    * PBE Functional
    * def2-SV(P) basis set
    * Pure water (dielectric constant ~ 78.4)

Importance of Redox Potentials

Redox potentials are quantities that represent how easily oxidizable or reducible an organic chemical is.
