# RedoxFlow

:sparkles:You have all been invited to the "RedoxFlow" Github through e-mail.:sparkles:
Tasks are listed in sequential order within scripts, e.g. 0_agent_construction , 1_llm_generate_A, 2_find_candidates_for_B, etc.
Scripts (1) - (8) sequentially follow each other in input/output (i.e., output from script (1) becomes input for script (2))
Each folder has a README file (e.g., 4_Task_README.txt ) that explains what needs to be made (what goes into the function, what comes out of the function).
Please upload your solution to the same folder in the form of a Jupyter notebook (unless stated otherwise in the task README file. This is how we will keep track of progress and test individual parts of the code.
Note that for certain tasks, e.g. (5), I provide functions that already get you halfway there and associated inputs/outputs to test with and validate. Please use them as a jumping off point, it will make your life easier.
